# Quantum-Shell
Simple quantum computer model.

Welcome to Quantum Shell.
This is a project that aims to help people interested in quantum computing gain more understanding
of it through interactive work with quantum computer mechanisms.

The quantum computer simulator presented here is based on a pretty solid quantum computing model.
While (of course) there is some room for improvement, I believe this application is a fine tool
for anyone interested in the topic - both as a standalone ready-to-use app or as a code base for
your own experiments. Provided examples (available both from the interpreter and in code)
should help you see how it is built and how to use it.

There is also some solid docummentation to find in this project (currently available in Polish and partially English.)
One paper contains a theoretical introduction ("Wstep" (PL) or "Introduction" (ENG)) while the other one
describes the architecture and solutions used in the application ("Symulator Komputera Kwantowego".)

Feel free to use it.
I kindly ask you to include the original header in your docummentation (#QuantumShell by Jakub Pilch - 3yakuya#)
if you decide to use my work in your research. I would also be very grateful for a message - write me
what do you build and how did you use Quantum Shell.
